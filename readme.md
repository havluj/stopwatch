# Stopwatch for AVR-8bit (ATmega169)
I wrote this simple stopwatch in assembly language for [AVR-8bit (ATmega169)](http://www.atmel.com/images/doc2514.pdf) as a project for my [Computer Structure and Architecture](https://edux.fit.cvut.cz/courses/BI-SAP/en/start) class.

## Disclaimer
This repository contains code that I wrote when studying Software Engineering at Czech Technical University in Prague.

The objective of these assignments was to write code that works, covers all edge cases, and is somewhat performant. Usually, there were additional rules we had to follow - like limits on the amount of memory our programs could use or that all code needed to be in a single file ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Please keep in mind that I wrote this code years ago and that it was a school assignment. This repository does not serve as the best example of my coding skills.
