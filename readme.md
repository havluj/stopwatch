# Stopwatch for AVR-8bit (ATmega169)
I wrote this simple stopwatch in assembly language for AVR-8bit (ATmega169) as a project for my Computer Structure and Architecture class.

## Disclaimer
The program is not properly tested nor is a best example of my coding skills. It needed to be written quickly and according to certain boudaries given by the class guidelines.
