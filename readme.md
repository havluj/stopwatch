# Stopwatch for AVR-8bit (ATmega169)
I wrote this simple stopwatch in assembly language for [AVR-8bit (ATmega169)](http://www.atmel.com/images/doc2514.pdf) as a project for my [Computer Structure and Architecture](https://edux.fit.cvut.cz/courses/BI-SAP/en/start) class.

## Disclaimer
The program is not properly tested nor is a best example of my coding skills. Please, be aware that I had to respect certain guidelines and boundaries and I had to write this program rapidly because this was a school project.
